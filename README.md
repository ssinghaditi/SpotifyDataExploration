# SpotifyDataExploration
Assignment: Despite the important role data now plays in the music industry, many companies are behind the “data curve.” To that end, Universal Music has hired you as a data analyst to help them understand how they can utilize Spotify to their benefit. Below are some of the questions Universal Music would like answered: 
  -	What can we learn about listeners’ music tastes at a high level from this data? Are there any discernable patterns in the data? 
  -	What are the key factors related to large number of streams? Are there simple rules to select songs with potentials of high streams?
  -	Based on the data, what direction is the Spotify ecosystem headed? Are the characteristics of popular songs consistent over time, or do they change in a       predictable way from year to year?
  -	What else can we learn from this data set?
